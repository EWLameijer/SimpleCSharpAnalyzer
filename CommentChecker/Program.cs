// goal:
// 1. List the comments found (ALL of them, including one-liners). If the same comment
// occurs multiple times, put it like [file1, file2, file3: 3x] // arrange
// 2. give options:
// 2a. approve (store) [all arrange]
// 2b. remove [if opened]
// 2c. skip (if require further action, typically todo-comments)

// NOTE: scanner should remark new comments that have not yet been resolved. Also all TODOs..
